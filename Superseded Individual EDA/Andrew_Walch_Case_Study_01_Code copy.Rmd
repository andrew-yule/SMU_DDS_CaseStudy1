Analysis Questions:
1.How many breweries are present in each state?
```{r}
#1.How many breweries are present in each state?

write_excel_csv(st_count, file = "num_brew " )
colnames(st_count)[1] = "abb" #rename state to abb for future merge

Analysis Questions:
1.1. Which states consume the most beer?
```{r}
# #the following Beer consumption data was found on the following article: https://vinepair.com/articles/map-states-drink-beer-america-2020/#:~:text=THE%20STATES%20THAT%20DRINK%20THE%20MOST%20BEER%20OVERALL,and%20New%20York%20trailing%20behind.%20Ranking%20The%20States
con_count = consume %>% group_by(abb) %>% summarize(Gallons = Gallons_Overall)  
write_excel_csv(con_count, file = "consume" )
#colnames(con_count)[1] = "abb" #rename state to abb for future merge
lookup = data.frame(abb = state.abb, State = state.name) #load in state names and state abbreviations to a dataframe for future merge Count
con_count = merge(con_count,lookup,"abb") #make a single data set with state names and abbreviations
con_count$region <- tolower(con_count$State) #make all state names lowercase for future merge
con_count = con_count[-1]
#states = map_data("state")
colnames(fifty_states)[6] = "region"
con_count = merge(fifty_states, con_count, by = "region", all.x = T) #merge the dateframes to include regions
con_count = con_count[order(con_count$order),] #order the dataframe to paint a proper map

```
2.   Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.  (RMD only, this does not need to be included in the presentation or the deck.)
```{r}
colnames(beer)[5] = "Brew_ID"  #rename brewery ID in Beers data to match Breweries data's brewery ID for future merge
colnames(beer)[1] = "Beer Name" #delineates between beer name and brewery names
colnames(brew)[2] = "Brewery Name"

bb = merge(beer, brew, by = "Brew_ID", all.x = T) #make the merge
head(bb) #1st six observations
tail(bb) #last six observations
```

3.   Address the missing values in each column.
```{r}
bb_clean = na.omit(bb) #%>% filter(!is.na(ABV) & !is.na(IBU) & !is.na(Style))

```


4.   Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

```{r}
#get the median values for each state
abv = bb_clean  %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(median(ABV)) 
ibu = bb_clean  %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(median(IBU))

#make a data frame from the median values
meds = merge(abv, ibu, by = "State") 
print(meds)
#order the states by median values
am = meds[order(meds$`median(ABV)`),]
im = meds[order(meds$`median(IBU)`),]





#Barplot for median ABV for each state
am %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(State, -`median(ABV)`), y = `median(ABV)`, fill = `median(ABV)`)) + geom_col() + ggtitle("Median ABV for Each State") + xlab("State") + ylab("Median ABV") + labs(fill = "Median ABV")



#ready US map plot for ABV for each state
colnames(am)[1] = "abb"
am  = merge(am ,lookup,"abb") #make a single data set with state names and abbreviations
am $region <- tolower(am $State) #make all state names lowercase for future merge
am  = am [-1]
colnames(fifty_states)[6] = "region"
am = merge(fifty_states, am, by = "region", all.x = T) #merge the dateframes to include regions
am = am[order(am$order),] #order the dataframe to paint a proper map

#heatmap for the median ABV for each state
am %>% ggplot(aes(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(aes(fill = `median(ABV)`)) + geom_path() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = hcl.colors(10, "RdYlGn", rev = TRUE), na.value = "grey90")+ggtitle("Median ABV for Each State") + xlab("Latitude") + ylab("Longitude") + coord_quickmap()






#Barplot for median IBU for each state
im %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(State, -`median(IBU)`), y = `median(IBU)`, fill = `median(IBU)`)) + geom_col() + ggtitle("Median IBU for Each State") + xlab("State") + ylab("Median IBU") + labs(fill = "Median IBU")



#ready US map plot for median IBU for each state
colnames(im)[1] = "abb"
im  = merge(im ,lookup,"abb") #make a single data set with state names and abbreviations
im $region <- tolower(im $State) #make all state names lowercase for future merge
im  = im [-1]
colnames(fifty_states)[6] = "region"
im = merge(fifty_states, im, by = "region", all.x = T) #merge the dateframes to include regions
im = im[order(im$order),] #order the dataframe to paint a proper map

#heatmap for the median IBU for each state
im %>% ggplot(aes(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(aes(fill = `median(IBU)`)) + geom_path() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = hcl.colors(10, "RdYlGn", rev = TRUE), na.value = "grey90")+ggtitle("Median IBU for Each State") + xlab("Latitude") + ylab("Longitude") + coord_quickmap()
```

5.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
```{r}
#order the states by median values
abv_max = bb_clean  %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(max(ABV)) 
abv_max = abv_max[order(-abv_max$`max(ABV)`),]
abv_max[1,]
ibu_max = bb_clean  %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(max(IBU))
ibu_max = ibu_max[order(-ibu_max$`max(IBU)`),]
ibu_max[1,]
```

6.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
```{r}

summary(bb_clean$ABV)
bb_clean %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ABV,  fill = "red" )) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle("ABV Value Distribution") + xlab("ABV Value") + ylab("Count of ABV Value")
shapiro.test(bb_clean$ABV)
qqPlot(bb_clean$ABV)
# The ABV values does not closely follow a normal distribution. In fact, it is slightly skewed right with a mean of 0.060 and median of 0.057. This implies that there are other variables that are influencing the ABV values for beers across the country. This information begs to be further analyzed to find relationships that ABV values could have with other variables. 


```


7.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.
```{r}
#assign categories for 
abv_cat = bb_clean %>% mutate(ABV_Category = cut(ABV, breaks = c(0,0.5000,0.05700, 0.06800, 0.12600), labels = c("Low","Medium", "High", "Very High")))

#summary(bb_clean$IBU)
abv_ibu_cat = abv_cat %>% mutate(IBU_Category = cut(IBU, breaks = c(0,21,35, 64, 139), labels = c("Low","Medium", "High", "Very High")))

p = abv_ibu_cat %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = IBU, y = ABV)) + geom_point(position = "jitter", color = "red") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") + ggtitle("International Bitterness Unit (IBU) vs Alcohol by Volume (ABV)") + xlim(0,150) + ylim(0,0.130)

ggMarginal(p, type="histogram", fill = "red")
#test relationships between the IBU and ABV variables
relate_test <-  cor.test(abv_ibu_cat$IBU, abv_ibu_cat$ABV, method = "spearman")
##########################################################
###Because the p-value of the test is 2.2e-16, which is less than the significance level alpha = 0.05. We can conclude that IBU and ABV are significantly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.6707224 and p-value of 2.2e-16.
##########################################################
#abv_ibu_cat %>% select(IBU, ABV, ABV_Category, IBU_Category) %>% ggpairs(aes(color = IBU_Category))
```



8.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.

In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) you may also feel free to supplement your response to this question with any other methods or techniques you have learned.  Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.
